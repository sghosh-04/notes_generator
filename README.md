## 🚀 Overview

The **Lecture Voice-to-Notes Generator** is an end-to-end AI system that converts lecture audio into structured, study-ready notes using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This project demonstrates practical implementation of:

- 🎙 Speech-to-Text using Faster-Whisper
- 🧠 Transformer-based summarization (T5/BART)
- 🔎 Keyword extraction (TF-IDF)
- 📊 Sentence embeddings (MiniLM)
- 🧩 Unsupervised topic clustering (KMeans)
- 📝 Structured note generation
- 📤 Export to PDF / DOCX

Designed as an **AIML project**, this system showcases real-world ML pipeline engineering, debugging, and deployment thinking.
